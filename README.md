# Campaign for Real Names

A celebration of traditional names that put the Great into Britain; why call your kids something trendy and modern when there are so many delightful yet under-used names available. Names with pedigree. Names with history.

##Compiling CSS

To compile the SCSS files you need to install [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/):

```
gem install sass
```

Once SASS is installed you can run the following command to manually compile the CSS file:

```
sass --watch scss/main.scss:css/main.css
```

Leave this running in a terminal window to watch for changes to any of the SCSS files, and to recompile the CSS automatically when changes are detected.
